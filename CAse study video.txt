Why Shopping Cart ?
 Nowdays the present very crucial to all over world because covoid pandamic is happening all over the world 
Durning this pandamic no one is going for out to buying 
so that i came with a website which is used for shopping which ever product people that means customer 
by sitting in home  they can buy the product ..


***********************************************************************************************

for creating of that website i have used the spring technologies which know well 

Technolgies i have used : 
for Backend 
	1.Spring Boot: Spring Boot helps developers create applications that just run. Specifically, 
		it lets you create standalone applications that run on their own, without relying on an external web server, 
		by embedding a web server such as Tomcat or Netty into your app during the initialization process
	2.Lombok : Its a spring boot Library and it used to remove the boilerplate code and save the 
	 	time for us  during development by just using some annotations.
	3.MongoCompass : It is used fo the connection of Mongodb Compass where the products of my webiste and customer details can be stored 
		in that database by creating new database for each of the microservice 
for UI (User-Interface)
	1.Angular 7.0 : In this angular it can able to create the website by implmemting some of the code like binding , forms ,reactive forms 
	2. Bootstrap 4.0 : Where this bootstrap can able to design the responviceness of the mycurrent webiste and also it can able to implememt the styles by some of the inbuild classes 

thats all about my brief introduction of my case study coming to the architecture of my case study 


************************************************************************************************************
	

lets us go into my archit... 
here i found 6 microservices along with that eureka server and api gateway 
 lets us talk about breif explain of each and every microservice ..
1. Eureka server : Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications.
		 Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server knows all the client applications 
		running on each port and IP address. Eureka Server is also known as Discovery Server.

2.API gateway :  It is Gateway where we can connect Front end And Backend With the Help of Routing Modules and Http
		An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. 
		An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, 
		and return the appropriate result.

3. Product: Where as admin can we add the products what ever they want to show in that shopping website so that customer can easily buy they prouct by 
	   shwoing them with some description , rating and price of the product 
	   if that customer is satisfied with anyone of the product that customer need to login /register so that case i am implement the profile microservice.

4.Profile Service: 
	1.Admin : Where Admin Access the whole Products Which ever we are added in the website that can see the no. of stocks remaining and 
		admin also access all other microservices where as customer and product details .
	2.Customer :Sign up: Where the customer new vister to the he/she want to register mandatory for buying a cart 
		    Sign In :where as the customer is already register he/she can directly login throught thier credetials and they can easily buy the product.
	
Once Sign in is done by the customer they can add they product in cart for selectinh no. of items they want that product 


5.Cart Service : In this Service customer can add they quantity of that product and that product is doing some arthimaticl opertaion after that its show subtotal of 
		that product 

6.Order Service : In this service Customer need to verify the shipping address and product payment Price 
		if the customer is ok with that all then customer need to go the wallet 
		
7.Wallet Service: In this Service If the customer is new to the Website and that customer need to create the wallet 
		after creating the wallet and go the order page and click on the status view so that customer can able to see that the product still pending in payment 
		So then we can make payment by clicking on makepayment 
		Finally the order is placed then it shows that order placed finally done and sign out of that shopping cart
